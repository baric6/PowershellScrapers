### Prefetch 

this powershell script just copies the prefetch files and paste them in a location you want

### What is it 
Since Windows XP, Windows creates a prefetch file every time you run an app for the first time. This file contains data the OS needs to speed up the app's load time whenever you run it. And this is a big help during the startup process since it helps Windows load faster.
